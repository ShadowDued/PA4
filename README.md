AI Tool Usage:
We mainly used the AI tool for better ways to runs side to side tests on the results the AI had compared to the results we got from the test. We also used the AI tool to tweak our code a little bit to have it be much more simpler than how we started. It made the readability of the code much easier and made it easier to comprehend.

Worked on assignment in real time with one another (virtually and in-person)
